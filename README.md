Code Challenge for Six Sigma
Here Are my notes:
Algorithms: I was not completely clear on the requirement for FormatSeparators() so I built a function that returns a concatenated string representation of the inbound list.
Class Refactroing: nice shout out to "The Holy Grail". I re-worked the class to be a static factory and simulated retrieval from a data store (hope you don't mind).
Frontend: I am enumerating a simple of array of login names each time "continue" is clicked. Not sure if you needed more. If so please let me know.
Synching: I solved the first bug but got stuck on the 2nd. I would love to know the final resolve.
